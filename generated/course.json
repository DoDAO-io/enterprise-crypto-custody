      "details": "Enterprise stores crypto in a variety of ways, depending on the specific requirements of the organization. Some common methods include:\n\n1. **Cold storage**: This involves storing the crypto offline, on a hardware wallet or paper wallet, to protect it from hacking and other online threats.\n\n2. **Multi-sig wallets**: This involves using multiple keys to access the crypto, with each key held by a different person or department, to increase security and control.\n\n3. **Custodial services**: This involves using a third-party service provider to securely store and manage the crypto on behalf of the enterprise.\n\n4. **Hardware Security Modules**: This is a specialized, tamper-resistant hardware that stores the cryptographic keys used to access the crypto.\n\n5. **A multiparty computation (MPC) wallet**: This technology enables multiple parties to jointly perform computations on sensitive data without revealing it to any of the parties involved.\n\nIn this course we will look at various ways enterprises can store their crypto and some of the most important requirements that enterprises have.",

          "details": "The MPC-CMP protocol, created by Fireblocks, applies the idea of MPC wallets to ECDSA and EdDSA signatures on blockchains (used by all blockchains). MPC-CMP has all of the great benefits that MPC-GG18 has, plus it helps with new operational challenges like regulations, security, and speed. In terms of speed, the quickest transaction signing speeds for digital assets are currently provided by MPC-CMP. Furthermore, this new algorithm has introduced a new security feature that automatically refreshes MPC key shares in minutes-long intervals. That means a malicious actor only has a few moments to steal all the key shards before the shares are refreshed, effectively adding a new layer of protection to our multi-layered crypto security system. In specific environments with stringent regulations regarding key storage, it may not be possible to use a standard MPC wallet because it requires an internet connection. MPC-CMP addresses this challenge by permitting hot and cold key signing mechanisms, where at least one key share is stored offline on an air-gapped device. To add an extra layer of security even in the event that one of the physical data centers is compromised, Fireblocks gives users a variety of choices for distributing the cryptographic MPC shares:\n\n- Distribution across multiple tier-1 cloud providers (Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud) \n- Distribution across several on-prem datacenters \n- Hybrid (on-prem data centers and cloud providers (such as Microsoft Azure) are used simultaneously)\n\nAs institutions have entered the ecosystem, new requirements for the digital asset area have emerged. MPC-CMP was created to fulfill these requirements and is future-proof.\n",

          "details": "Intel SGX is a hardware-level security feature that creates an isolated area within a system, similar to an HSM (hardware security module) from the operating system. Its purpose is to protect cryptographic material, algorithms, and the execution of sensitive code from insiders (such as rogue administrators) and hackers. SGX enclaves are a great way to distribute private keys with a very high level of security. By using them on a minimum of 3-5 machines, each on a separate network, you can be sure that your keys will be safe. The keys are kept in SGX, so even if malware or a hacker gains access to the server's operating system, they cannot be removed because the memory and the data in the SGX enclave are encrypted. SGX is used to store API keys in order to keep them secure from potential hackers. Exchange credentials are stored in TEEs, or Trusted Execution Environments so that not even Fireblocks employees can retrieve the information.\n",

          "details": "The Fireblocks Policy Engine is the next step for digital asset security, allowing organizations to set up specific approval policies for every transaction. With the Policy Engine, users can configure a list of rules that determine how transactions are handled and approved. For example, a rule can block, approve, or require additional signers for a transaction based on filters such as source, destination, asset, and amount. Fireblocks has implemented SGX security measures in order to protect the Policy Engine. This involves distributing policy verification among several MPC servers. In addition, the policy rules are signed by a quorum of administrators and encrypted within SGX. By taking these measures, Fireblocks prevents both hackers and insiders (such as IT administrators) from modifying the implemented rules or the logic of the policy engine.\n",

          "shortTitle": "Working",
          "details": "In order to prevent the entire private key from being taken from a single device in the event that a hacker or insider penetrates the device, the MPC wallet is used to distribute the private key into shares using a threshold signature across multiple servers or devices. The hardware isolation of each individual key share protects them from being extracted by an attacker, even if they control the machine. This way, no single private key share can be compromised. This is done using Intel SGX. Device distribution across many physical data centers is done to reduce physical attacks. Verification of counterparties' deposit addresses over secure channels that are resistant to host-based attacks is done to remove human error on deposit addresses. The final step involves separating responsibilities across various corporate areas and enforcing policies/approval processes.\n\n",
