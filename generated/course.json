      "details": "Enterprise stores crypto in a variety of ways, depending on the specific requirements of the organization. Some common methods include:\n\n1. **Cold storage**: This involves storing the crypto offline, on a hardware wallet or paper wallet, to protect it from hacking and other online threats.\n\n2. **Multi-sig wallets**: This involves using multiple keys to access the crypto, with each key held by a different person or department, to increase security and control.\n\n3. **Custodial services**: This involves using a third-party service provider to securely store and manage the crypto on behalf of the enterprise.\n\n4. **Hardware Security Modules**: This is a specialized, tamper-resistant hardware that stores the cryptographic keys used to access the crypto.\n\n5. **A multiparty computation (MPC) wallet**: This technology enables multiple parties to jointly perform computations on sensitive data without revealing it to any of the parties involved.\n\nIn this course we will look at various ways enterprises can store their crypto and some of the most important requirements that enterprises have.",
