      Enterprise stores crypto in a variety of ways, depending on the specific
      requirements of the organization. Some common methods include:


      1. **Cold storage**: This involves storing the crypto offline, on a
      hardware wallet or paper wallet, to protect it from hacking and other
      online threats.


      2. **Multi-sig wallets**: This involves using multiple keys to access the
      crypto, with each key held by a different person or department, to
      increase security and control.


      3. **Custodial services**: This involves using a third-party service
      provider to securely store and manage the crypto on behalf of the
      enterprise.


      4. **Hardware Security Modules**: This is a specialized, tamper-resistant
      hardware that stores the cryptographic keys used to access the crypto.


      5. **A multiparty computation (MPC) wallet**: This technology enables
      multiple parties to jointly perform computations on sensitive data without
      revealing it to any of the parties involved.


      In this course we will look at various ways enterprises can store their
      crypto and some of the most important requirements that enterprises have.
