    Fireblocks has a multi-layer security system that includes MPC, Intel SGX, a
    Policy Engine, and a deposit address authentication network. This ensures
    that usersâ€™ assets are protected from cyberattacks, internal collusion, and
    human error.

    The MPC-CMP protocol, created by Fireblocks, applies the idea of MPC wallets
    to ECDSA and EdDSA signatures on blockchains (used by all blockchains).
    MPC-CMP has all of the great benefits that MPC-GG18 has, plus it helps with
    new operational challenges like regulations, security, and speed. In terms
    of speed, the quickest transaction signing speeds for digital assets are
    currently provided by MPC-CMP. Furthermore, this new algorithm has
    introduced a new security feature that automatically refreshes MPC key
    shares in minutes-long intervals. That means a malicious actor only has a
    few moments to steal all the key shards before the shares are refreshed,
    effectively adding a new layer of protection to our multi-layered crypto
    security system. In specific environments with stringent regulations
    regarding key storage, it may not be possible to use a standard MPC wallet
    because it requires an internet connection. MPC-CMP addresses this challenge
    by permitting hot and cold key signing mechanisms, where at least one key
    share is stored offline on an air-gapped device. To add an extra layer of
    security even in the event that one of the physical data centers is
    compromised, Fireblocks gives users a variety of choices for distributing
    the cryptographic MPC shares:


    - Distribution across multiple tier-1 cloud providers (Microsoft Azure and
    IBM Cloud) 

    - Distribution across several on-prem datacenters 

    - Hybrid (on-prem data centers and cloud providers (such as Microsoft Azure)
    are used simultaneously)


    As institutions have entered the ecosystem, new requirements for the digital
    asset area have emerged. MPC-CMP was created to fulfill these requirements
    and is future-proof.

    Intel SGX is a hardware-level security feature that creates an isolated area
    within a system, similar to an HSM (hardware security module) from the
    operating system. Its purpose is to protect cryptographic material,
    algorithms, and the execution of sensitive code from insiders (such as rogue
    administrators) and hackers. SGX enclaves are a great way to distribute
    private keys with a very high level of security. By using them on a minimum
    of 3-5 machines, each on a separate network, you can be sure that your keys
    will be safe. The keys are kept in SGX, so even if malware or a hacker gains
    access to the server's operating system, they cannot be removed because the
    memory and the data in the SGX enclave are encrypted. SGX is used to store
    API keys in order to keep them secure from potential hackers. Exchange
    credentials are stored in TEEs, or Trusted Execution Environments so that
    not even Fireblocks employees can retrieve the information.
